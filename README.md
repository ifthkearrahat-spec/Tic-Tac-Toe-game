-->Tic Tac Toe (Python)

A simple terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game written in Python.
The player plays against the computer in the command line.

# How It Works

The game board has 9 blocks, numbered 1 to 9.

The player chooses a number (1–9) to place their mark.

The computer chooses a block randomly from the available spaces.

A simple function checks after each move to decide:

Win

Lose

Draw

-->How to Run

Clone the repository or download the file.

Open a terminal in the project folder.

Run the game using:

python tic_tac_toe.py
